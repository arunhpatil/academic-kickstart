bio: My research interests include adaptation and evolution of fish after disruptive evolutionary events. Most of my research focusses on the evolution of Antarctic Notothenioids as well as the consequences of the Teleost Genome Duplication. I study miRNAs for their genetic evolution and for their potential role in canalizing development and phenotypes at evolutionary time-scale.
